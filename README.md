# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome  
# My name's Vineeth 

I love the F1, the guitar and have an eye on every detail I could find in the UI. As fancy as the UI can get, sometimes I believe, it's better to be simple.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Portfolio using multiple technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Angular etc.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on UI fixes on the products I'm using. (Like PrimeNG)

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Data Science in Medical field.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about F1, FRIENDS, Sports.
